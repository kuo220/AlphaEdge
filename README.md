# AlphaEdge

**AlphaEdge** is a *trading framework* designed for backtesting trading strategies, generating backtest reports, and enabling *live trading* through the [Shioaji API](https://sinotrade.github.io/zh_TW/). It supports backtesting and trading for **stocks, futures, and options** (though currently, only stock trading has been implemented).

To get started, users should follow the instructions in [Strategy Instruction](trader/strategies/README.md) and complete the following steps:

1. Familiarize themselves with the backtest Data API.
2. Develop a trading strategy.
3. Configure the strategy parameters.
