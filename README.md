`Backtester` is the **only** backtest engine: market-agnostic, no subclasses. All market-specific behavior is injected as five pluggable models (`InstrumentSpec`, `FillModel`, `CostModel`, `SettlementModel`, `DataFeed`) assembled by `factory.py` from the `market` + `instrument_type` a strategy declares. Adding a (market, instrument) combination does not require changing `backtester.py`. See [Multi-Market Engine](docs/backtest/multi-market-engine.md) and [Module Map](docs/backtest/module-map.md).



## Backtest Coverage

Each backtest runs one (market, instrument) combination, declared by the strategy base and dispatched by `factory.py`. Direction (LONG / SHORT) and instrument type are independent axes: accounting always follows each order's `position_type`, and the strategy's `allowed_directions` is only a direction whitelist.

Data ranges below reflect an inventory of `data/db` taken on 2026-09-15 and will move as the data is updated.

| Market × Instrument | Status | Scope and data range | Bar scale | Directions | Strategy base |
| ------------------- | ------ | -------------------- | --------- | ---------- | ------------- |
| TW stocks (`TW` × `STOCK`) | ✅ Supported | Symbols in `tw_stock.db`: prices 2013-01-02 – 2026-09-15 (2,392 symbols on the latest trading day)<br>Signals use adjusted prices by default; ex-dividend and corporate-action data also start 2013-01<br>Margin trading balances and institutional chip data 2013-01-02 – 2026-09-14 | `DAY`, `TICK` (ticks live in DolphinDB, not `data/db`; needs the `[tick]` extra) | **LONG**: fully cash-funded (no margin financing), overnight or intraday<br>**SHORT**: `DAY_TRADE` (cash day-trade short), `MARGIN` (margin-account short, overnight, default), `SBL` (securities borrowing, overnight); borrow fees, maintenance-ratio margin call and ex-dividend forced cover included<br>Long and short can coexist across symbols; opposite positions in the same symbol are rejected | `BaseStockStrategy` |
| TW index futures (`TW` × `FUTURE`) | ✅ Supported | TX, MTX, TMF, TE, ZEF, TF, ZFF; automatic contract roll<br>**Day-session prices** (`DAY`): TX / MTX / TE / TF from 2015-01-05 (backfill start), ZEF from 2021-06-28, ZFF from 2021-12-06, TMF from 2024-07-29 (listing dates); updated to 2026-09-01 – 09-03<br>**Night-session prices** (`NIGHT` / `COMBINED`): TX / MTX from 2017-05-16, TE from 2018-11-20, ZEF from 2021-06-29, TMF from 2024-07-30; **TF / ZFF only from 2025-06-24**<br>**Margin** (lookup mode): TX / MTX from 2020-03-13, TE / TF from 2020-07-22, ZEF from 2021-08-12, ZFF from 2022-01-26, TMF from 2024-08-09 | `DAY` only | **LONG / SHORT**: the same margin trading, daily mark-to-market and margin call; no borrow availability or borrow fees<br>Long and short can coexist across contracts; opposite positions in the same contract are rejected | `BaseFuturesStrategy` |
| Stock futures / ETF futures | ❌ Not backtestable yet | **Data**: universe of 320 products (249 single-stock, 47 mini single-stock, 21 ETF, 3 mini ETF), snapshots only for 2026-08-29 – 09-02; prices only for three trial products: CDF, NYF (2026-08-27 – 08-28) and EEF (2026-08-27 day session)<br>**Code blocker**: `FuturesPositionManager.open_position()` looks up the multiplier in `FUTURES_MULTIPLIER`, which has no stock futures, so **the first open raises `KeyError`** in both lookup and ratio margin modes (the DataFeed already reads the universe; the position manager does not)<br>**Other gaps**: single-stock futures margin lives in the rate table while lookup mode only reads the amount table, so opens abort (ETF future NYF is in the amount table from 2020-07-22); contract sizes only go back to the 2026-08-29 snapshot | `DAY` only | Designed like TW index futures, but aborts on the first open | `BaseFuturesStrategy` |
| US market, options | ❌ Not supported | `Market.US` and `InstrumentType.OPTION` are defined only; the factory raises `ValueError` | — | — | — |

> - Holding both directions requires `allowed_directions = {LONG, SHORT}`; a LONG intraday strategy must declare `bar_execution_order = OPEN_THEN_CLOSE` itself.
> - `enable_intraday` defaults to `True`, so a SHORT strategy goes through `DAY_TRADE` automatically; to hold shorts overnight, set it to `False` and pick a `short_method`.
> - Futures calendar-spread legs each pay full margin (spread margin is not modeled).

### Main limitations

- Tick-level futures backtests are not implemented (`TwFuturesDataFeed.get_quotes()` returns an empty list).
- The futures margin lookup start date differs per product (earliest 2020-03, see the table); earlier periods can only use the `FuturesMarginConfig.ratio()` approximation, which distorts tradable lots and margin-call thresholds.
- Futures tick size is only registered for the TAIEX futures family (1 point); TE / ZEF / TF / ZFF are distorted if slippage is set in ticks (default slippage is 0, so unaffected).
- A single backtest cannot hold TW stocks and TW futures at the same time (cross-market portfolios / hedging).
- The TW stock below-reference-price short restriction and the daily day-trade whitelist are not wired into matching yet, so short and day-trade opportunities are overestimated.
- The `--mode live` path is not implemented.

See [Short-Selling Framework](docs/backtest/short-selling-framework.md) and [TW Futures Platform](docs/futures/tw-futures-platform.md) for details.

## Environment Setup

First time here? Go in order: **prepare the database → pick one of the three ways to run → (if needed) set environment variables**.
Section 4 is only for changing the code.

### 1. Prepare the database

Backtests and the frontend need the SQLite3 databases. Download them from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1iKTpnfECyHIgVj9SJ2al5BKBwceXr_ZE?usp=share_link)
and put them in `data/db/` under the project root (the code expects `data/db/tw_stock.db` and `data/db/tw_futures.db`).

```text
AlphaEdge/
└── data/
    └── db/
        ├── tw_stock.db
        └── tw_futures.db
```

To bring the data up to date afterwards, see "Update database" under Command Usage below.

### 2. Choose how to run it (pick one)

All three run the same code — **pick one and follow it**; you do not need all of them:

| Option | Best for | Install first | Where backtest results go |
| ------ | -------- | ------------- | ------------------------- |
| Option 1: Local Python (recommended) | Writing strategies, changing code | Python 3.12+ | `results/` at the project root |
| Option 2: Docker Compose | No Python install; one command to backtest and view results | Docker | Docker volume `alphaedge_results` |
| Option 3: Docker Container | Controlling the backtest and frontend containers separately | Docker | `results/` at the project root (mounted) |

#### Option 1: Local Python (recommended)

**Step 1: Create a virtualenv and install**

macOS / Linux:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv                       # create the virtualenv
source .venv/bin/activate                   # activate it
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt   # install dependencies and the project itself
```

Windows (PowerShell or CMD):

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The last line of `requirements.txt` is `-e .`, so the same command installs the project too, and
`core` / `tasks` / `tests` are importable from any directory. Activate the virtualenv in every new
terminal; run `deactivate` to leave it.

**Step 2: Run a backtest**

```bash
python run.py --strategy MomentumStrategy1
```

- `--strategy` takes a strategy class name; existing strategies live in `core/strategies/stock/` and `core/strategies/futures/`.
- Optional: `--show` opens charts in a browser; `--mode live` is not implemented (exits with code 1).
- Results are written to `results/` at the project root.

**Step 3: Open the frontend to view results**

The frontend packages are not in the base install, so add them once:

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[frontend]"   # one-time
streamlit run frontend/app.py
```

Open `http://localhost:8501`. Leave the frontend running and use another terminal tab (with the virtualenv activated) to keep running backtests.

#### Option 2: Docker Compose

One command builds and starts two containers: `core` runs one backtest and exits, `frontend` keeps serving the page.

```bash
# Build images and start (default strategy: MomentumStrategy1)
docker compose up --build

# Use a different strategy
STRATEGY=MomentumFuturesStrategy docker compose up

# Run in the background / stop and remove containers
docker compose up -d
docker compose down
```

Open `http://localhost:8501`. After changing code, add `--build` so the images pick up the change.

> The images contain **no database**; compose mounts the host's `./data` **read-only**. Skip
> "1. Prepare the database" and the backtest fails at `sqlite3.connect`. Read-only is deliberate:
> the container only runs backtests and must not write to the host database.
> Backtest results go to the `alphaedge_results` volume; logs go to the host's `./logs`.

#### Option 3: Docker Container

**Step 1: Build the images**

```bash
docker build -f core/Dockerfile -t alphaedge-core .
docker build -f frontend/Dockerfile -t alphaedge-frontend .
```

**Step 2: Run a backtest**

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -v "$(pwd)/data:/app/data:ro" \
  -v "$(pwd)/results:/app/results" \
  alphaedge-core --strategy MomentumStrategy1
```

The image has no database, so mount the host `data/` read-only; results are written back to the host
`results/`, otherwise they vanish when the container exits. To type commands inside the container
instead, use `--entrypoint /bin/bash` with `-it`, then run `python run.py --help`.

**Step 3: Start the frontend**

```bash
docker run --rm -p 8501:8501 -v "$(pwd)/results:/results:ro" alphaedge-frontend
```

Open `http://localhost:8501`. The frontend reads the mounted `results/`; without the mount it shows no backtests.

### 3. Set environment variables (optional)

**Skip this if you only run daily backtests.** To update data or use ticks, copy the template and fill in what you need:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

| Variable | Purpose | Needed when |
| -------- | ------- | ----------- |
| `DDB_PATH`, `DDB_HOST`, `DDB_PORT`, `DDB_USER`, `DDB_PASSWORD` | DolphinDB connection | Accessing tick data, running tick backtests |
| `API_KEY`, `API_SECRET_KEY` | Sinopac Shioaji API | Crawling tick data |
| `FINMIND_API_TOKEN` | FinMind API | Updating FinMind data (stock overview, brokers, broker branches) |

`.env` is read by the local code; the Docker images do not include it. Details in [Dev Setup](docs/setup/dev-setup.md).

### 4. Developer tools (when changing code)

Inside the Option 1 virtualenv, add the dev extras:

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"   # pytest, pytest-timeout, pytest-cov, ruff
```

Other optional extras: `tick` (DolphinDB tick storage), `lab` (`strategy_lab` report output); the backtest and ETL paths run without them.

**Lint, format and tests**

```bash
ruff check .            # CLAUDE.md §2.5 / §2.10, configured in pyproject.toml
ruff format .
pytest -m "not slow"    # skips tests needing tw_stock.db or API credentials
pytest                  # full suite (needs data/db/tw_stock.db)
./scripts/run_regression.sh   # LONG + SHORT regression, must stay row-identical
```

**Pre-commit checks**: run ruff, the layer-dependency gate and the doc path check automatically before each commit (tests and the API orphan-method check are left to CI).

```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install       # one-time; installs the git hook
pre-commit run --all-files
```

**CI**: on every push GitHub Actions runs, in order: `ruff check`, `ruff format --check`, the
layer-dependency gate (`scripts/check_layer_deps.py`), the doc path check
(`scripts/check_doc_paths.py`), the API orphan-method check
(`scripts/check_api_orphan_methods.py`), the SHORT regression line, and
`pytest -m "not slow"`, finishing with a coverage report under `continue-on-error`
(see `.github/workflows/ci.yml`). **The LONG regression line needs
`data/db/tw_stock.db`, which CI does not have, so it only runs locally.**

## Command Usage

### Update database

For full target reference and single/multi-target examples, see [Command Usage](docs/commands/command-usage.md).

```bash
python -m tasks.update_db --target no_tick
```

### Run backtest

Replace `<StrategyClassName>` with your strategy class name. More command scenarios are documented in [Command Usage](docs/commands/command-usage.md).

```bash
python run.py --strategy <StrategyClassName>
# optional: --show opens charts in a browser; --mode live is not implemented (exits with code 1)
```
